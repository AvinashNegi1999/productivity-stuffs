- Use electives to reduce load (pick easier ones strategically)
- Summer breaks for **interview prep**

---

### 2. Some Outdated Content ⚠️

| Subject | Semester | Outdated Content | Should Be |
|---------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **OOP with Java** | Sem 2 | Java Swing, Applets | JavaFX, Spring Boot |
| **Web Technology** | Sem 4 | jQuery, AngularJS | React, Next.js, Vue 3 |
| **Mobile Dev** | Sem 5 | iOS with Objective-C | Swift, SwiftUI |

#### Impact

- ⚠️ Learn outdated tech in class, modern tech on own time
- ⚠️ Campus projects may not impress FAANG recruiters

#### Fix

- Self-study modern equivalents (React, Swift) in parallel
- Use major project (Sem 6) to showcase **modern stack**

---

### 3. Missing Modern Essentials ⚠️⚠️

#### Critical Gaps

##### System Design (HLD/LLD) - NOT COVERED

- **Impact:** Can't crack FAANG L4+ interviews
- **Fix:** Self-study "Grokking System Design" course

##### LeetCode/Interview Patterns - NOT TAUGHT

- **What's Covered:** Data Structures, Algorithms (theory)
- **What's Missing:** Interview-specific patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)
- **Fix:** NeetCode 150, Striver's SDE Sheet

##### Modern Backend Stack - INCOMPLETE

- **What's Covered:** Node.js basics, REST APIs
- **What's Missing:** GraphQL, Redis, Kafka, Microservices (practical)
- **Fix:** Udemy courses + personal projects

##### CI/CD Pipelines - ELECTIVE ONLY

- **Problem:** DevOps is elective, not mandatory
- **Reality:** Every company uses CI/CD in 2024
- **Fix:** Take DevOps elective OR self-study

---

### 4. Business Courses Feel Forced ⚠️

#### Mandatory Non-Tech Courses

- **Sem 3:** Accounting & Financial Management (3 credits)
- **Sem 3:** Business Communication (2 credits)
- **Sem 5:** Organizational Behavior (3 credits)

#### Optional (Electives)

- Marketing Management
- Business Ethics
- Business Intelligence

#### Critique

- ❓ Why is Accounting **mandatory** for MCA students?
- ❓ Could replace with Advanced React, MLOps, or Kubernetes

#### Counter-Argument

- ✅ Useful for **entrepreneurship** or **product management** pivot
- ✅ NIT wants "well-rounded" graduates, not just coders

> **Verdict:** Tolerable, but **wastes 2-3 course slots**
