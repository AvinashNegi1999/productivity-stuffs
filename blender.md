# 🏗️ Roadmap: Blender Skills for 3DXChat Environment Building

This roadmap is designed for players who want to **use Blender skills to become better 3DXChat world builders**.  
Blender has a huge toolbox, but here we focus only on the skills that **transfer directly** to 3DXChat’s World Editor.

## 📅 6-Week Learning Plan

### **Phase 1: Core Blender Survival Kit (Week 1–2)**
🎯 Goal: Get comfortable moving in 3D space & handling objects.  
- Learn navigation (orbit, pan, zoom).  
- Master transforms: **G (move), R (rotate), S (scale)**.  
- Practice duplicating & arranging cubes like LEGO.

---

### **Phase 2: Geometry & Building Blocks (Week 2–3)**
🎯 Goal: Understand how 3D objects are built, and think in modular pieces.  
- Mesh basics: **vertices, edges, faces**.  
- Tools: Extrude (E), Inset (I), Loop Cut (Ctrl+R).  
- Create simple objects: walls, floors, stairs.  
- Use **Array & Mirror Modifiers** for repeating and symmetry.

### **Phase 3: Materials & Lighting (Week 3–4)**
🎯 Goal: Make builds look good (even without custom textures in 3DXChat).  
- Apply simple materials (color, roughness, metallic).  
- Learn 3D lighting basics: point, area, and sun lamps.  
- Experiment with mood lighting (club scene vs. beach scene).

### **Phase 4: Composition & Scene Layout (Week 4–5)**
🎯 Goal: Build full environments with modular design.  
- Block out a house using cubes.  
- Repeat floor/wall tiles with Array Modifier.  
- Organize scenes with Collections.  
- Place cameras to plan how people will view the space.

---

### **Phase 5: Apply Skills to 3DXChat (Week 5–6)**
🎯 Goal: Transfer Blender thinking into 3DXChat’s World Editor.  
- Use **modular design** with primitives.  
- Apply **Array/Mirror mindset** with copy-paste in the editor.  
- Replicate Blender lighting setups with lamps in 3DXChat.  
- Build a simple room in 3DXChat inspired by your Blender scene.  

---

### **Phase 6: (Optional Advanced Path)**
🎯 Goal: Automate and experiment.  
- Learn **Geometry Nodes** for procedural generation (grids, forests, repeating structures).  
- Explore exporting layouts → converting into **3DXChat XML format** (advanced).
