| Month/Period | Tasks / Goals | Funding Focus | Notes / Tips |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Now – Dec 2025** | - Strengthen CS/math fundamentals (Algorithms, DS, OS, DB, Probability, Linear Algebra, ML basics) <br> - Build portfolio projects (ML/AI, Databases, Systems) <br> - Participate in coding competitions/hackathons <br> - Identify 2–3 potential Stanford faculty | N/A | Highlight projects in GitHub; aim for 3–5 polished projects |
| **Jan – Mar 2025** | - Research funding options <br> - Start Knight-Hennessy application draft <br> - Explore external scholarships (Inlaks, Narotam, Fulbright-Nehru, Tata) <br> - Collect loan info | Knight-Hennessy, External scholarships | Collect transcripts, SOP draft, CV, bank statements for scholarships |
| **Apr – Jun 2025** | - Prepare Stanford MSCS application <br> - SOP emphasizing BCA → CS transition <br> - CV/resume highlighting research/projects <br> - Letters of Recommendation (2 academic + 1 professional) <br> - Draft faculty contact emails (research interest + RA/TA inquiry) | Departmental RA/TA interest | Tailor SOP for funding + research interest |
| **Jul – Sept 2025** | - Submit Stanford MSCS application (~Dec 2025 intake, confirm exact) <br> - Submit Knight-Hennessy application (~Sept 2025) <br> - Submit external scholarships | Knight-Hennessy, Inlaks/Narotam/Fulbright | Ensure all supporting documents uploaded: transcripts, LORs, SOP |
| **Oct – Dec 2025** | - Faculty engagement: send research-focused emails with 1-page summary & CV <br> - Scholarship follow-ups/interviews <br> - Apply for backup loans | RA/TA positions, External scholarship status | Keep polite, concise emails; track deadlines |

### Tips for Each Phase

1. **Profile Building (Now – Dec 2025)**
   - Publish small workshop papers if possible.
   - Document all projects on GitHub with clear README and results.
   - Gain hands-on skills in Python, Java, SQL, Git, Linux.

2. **Funding Applications**
   - Knight-Hennessy: leadership + research + community impact essays.
   - External scholarships: emphasize academic excellence + financial need.
   - Departmental RA/TA: email faculty **after admission**; attach project summary.

3. **Application Materials**
   - SOP: clear narrative bridging BCA → advanced CS concepts.
   - LOR: focus on research/problem-solving skills, not just coursework grades.
   - CV: project + internship heavy; optional publication list.

4. **Visa & Financial Documentation**
   - Award letters + bank statements + loans must cover at least first-year cost (tuition + living).
   - Include currency conversion (INR → USD) for consulate if needed.
