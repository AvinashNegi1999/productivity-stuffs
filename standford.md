# Executive summary

* **Short answer:** Stanford **does not generally guarantee full funding for master’s students**; funding is limited and far more common for PhD students. Expect funding to be **competitive and department-dependent** (more likely in some engineering labs, much less likely in professional master’s). ([Stanford Financial Aid][1], [Graduate Financial Support][2])
* Main funding pathways: **departmental assistantships (RA/TA/PI grants)**, **university/central fellowships**, **Knight-Hennessy Scholars**, and **external Indian scholarships / loans**. ([Graduate Financial Support][2], [knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][3], [vpge.stanford.edu][4])
* Priority actions (next steps): (1) **Apply for Knight-Hennessy** if eligible; (2) **identify 3–6 Stanford faculty whose labs match your research** and contact them before/after admission; (3) **apply to external Indian fellowships (Inlaks, Fulbright-Nehru, Narotam)**; (4) **indicate funding interest on your departmental application** and prepare a short research statement & funding pitch.

# 1 — Funding pathways (what they are, pros/cons, competitiveness, who decides, coverage, stipend, timing)

> Compact comparison table (quick view)

| Pathway                                              |                                                   Who decides |                                                                                                                                                           Typical tuition covered |                                                                                            Stipend typical? |                                     Employment required? | Competitiveness / notes                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Departmental: RA (Research Asst.)**                |                               PI / lab (faculty + dept admin) |                                                   Often **100%** when funded via grant (depends on grant/TAL rules). ([Graduate Financial Support][2], [Administrative Guide][8]) |                           **Yes** (variable; usually accompanies tuition allowance) ([Student Services][9]) |                                      Yes (research work) | **Moderate–high** (faculty tend to prioritize PhD students; master’s places limited)                            |
| **Departmental: TA (Teaching Asst.)**                |                               Dept staffing / instructor + HR | **25% TA often covers full TGR tuition** per policy when at 25% appointment — check dept rules. ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][10], [Grad Policies and Procedures][11]) | **Yes** (salary tied to % appointment; there are minimum salary tables). ([Graduate Financial Support][12]) |                                    Yes (teaching duties) | **Moderate** (many TA slots go to PhD students; masters may get some)                                           |
| **PI/project funding**                               |                                             PI + grant budget |                                                                                                           Varies (can cover tuition + stipend if grant allows) ([DoResearch][13]) |                                                                                 **Yes** (set by PI & grant) |                                Yes (research on project) | **Depends on PI funding; higher if PI has active grants**                                                       |
| **University / central fellowships** (school / VPGE) |                      University committees, nominated by dept |   Can be **tuition + stipend** (varies by fellowship: Short/medium durations). Example: Stanford Graduate Fellowships for S\&E (doctoral) — PhD-focused. ([vpge.stanford.edu][4]) |                                                       **Yes** (stipend often included for the award period) |     No employment required while on fellowship (usually) | **Very competitive**; many are PhD-focused                                                                      |
| **Knight-Hennessy Scholars**                         |                           Knight-Hennessy selection committee |                                          **Full tuition + stipend** for up to 3 years (covers graduate study costs & leadership programming). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][3]) |                       **Yes** (comprehensive living + stipend support). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][3]) |                                          No (fellowship) | **Extremely competitive** (global competition; open to master’s applicants) ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5]) |
| **External scholarships (Indian)**                   | External foundations (Inlaks, Fulbright-Nehru, Narotam, etc.) |                                                    Varies — can be partial or full (depends on award rules). ([studentcover.in][6], [Welcome to][7], [pg.nsfoundation.co.in][14]) |                                                                                   Sometimes (covers living) | No (fellowship)/may require return or service conditions | **Competitive** but excellent leverage for applicants from India                                                |
| **Loans & paid internships**                         |               Banks / private lenders; Stanford-approved work |                                                                                                    Loans don’t “cover” tuition in the sense of waiver; internships provide income |                                                                                                         N/A |                                  Internships = paid work | Loans common (SBI/Indian banks, foreign student loans); internships limited during study due to visa rules      |

**Timing (typical):**

* **RA/TA offers**: can be made at **offer of admission** or shortly after (some PIs recruit earlier via email). Departments typically notify admitted students when assistantships are available (timing varies by dept). ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][15], [Administrative Guide][8])
* **University fellowships / Knight-Hennessy**: separate application timelines (Knight-Hennessy has a distinct application with its own deadline; awards announced in a cycle overlapping admission decisions). Check Knight-Hennessy deadline for the cohort year. ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5])
* **External scholarships**: have fixed cycles (e.g., Inlaks, Fulbright) — apply early (months before enrollment).

---

# 2 — Departmental funding details & mechanics (RA / TA / PI funding)

**RA (Research Assistantship)**

* **Who decides:** PI (faculty) + department administration (grant rules). ([DoResearch][13])
* **Pros:** Often covers tuition **and** includes a stipend; directly tied to research — excellent for career & publication building. ([Graduate Financial Support][12])
* **Cons:** Highly dependent on PI grant budgets; many PIs prioritize PhD students; RA slots for masters are limited.
* **Coverage:** Can cover **100% tuition + stipend** when funded by grants/TAL; proportion and duration vary by appointment. ([Graduate Financial Support][2])
* **Timing:** Offered any time a PI has funds — sometimes before admission (recruitment email), sometimes after arrival.

**TA (Teaching Assistantship)**

* **Who decides:** Department teaching office; assignments coordinated by course instructors & department. ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][15])
* **Pros:** Clear workload (grading, running labs), predictable salary & tuition allowance; certain % appointments carry tuition allowances (policy: e.g., one 25% assistantship covers full tuition for TGR students). ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][10], [Grad Policies and Procedures][11])
* **Cons:** Time-consuming teaching work; TA slots often prioritized for PhD students.
* **Coverage:** A 25% assistantship typically provides a tuition allowance (check your program’s TGR tuition rules). Salary determined by the salary/TAL tables. ([Graduate Financial Support][12])

**PI / Project Funding**

* Similar to RA — awarded at PI discretion; sometimes short-term hourly positions are available in summer.

---

# 3 — University/central fellowships & Knight-Hennessy

**Stanford Graduate Fellowships (SGF) and VPGE awards**

* Many central fellowships are **PhD-focused** and awarded via departmental nomination. Masters applicants are **less commonly** eligible — check each fellowship page. Example: SGF is targeted at doctoral students in S\&E. ([vpge.stanford.edu][4])

**Knight-Hennessy Scholars (KHS)**

* **What it covers:** up to **three years** of full funding for graduate study at Stanford (tuition, stipend, experiential programming). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][3])
* **Eligibility & application relationship:** KHS is a **separate** application (you *must* apply to KHS in addition to your Stanford program; being admitted to Stanford is required to matriculate as a Knight-Hennessy scholar but **you can apply to KHS before you have an offer**). KHS accepts applicants across disciplines and to master’s programs (check cohort-specific eligibility). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5])
* **Competitiveness:** **Extremely competitive** (global pool). If awarded, KHS **effectively fully funds** a master’s student for up to 3 years.

---

# 4 — External scholarships (Indian applicants) — 3–5 examples (one-line eligibility)

1. **Inlaks Shivdasani Foundation Scholarship** — supports Indian citizens for postgraduate study abroad; age limits and “no prior postgraduate study abroad” rules apply. (Apply early; award can be sizable). ([studentcover.in][6], [Buddy4Study][16])
2. **Fulbright-Nehru Master’s Fellowships** — for Indian citizens with work experience, for select U.S. master’s programs (leadership focus); rigorous selection via USIEF. ([Welcome to][7], [Fulbright Online][17])
3. **Narotam Sekhsaria Foundation PG Scholarships** — merit scholarships for Indian students for study at top institutions abroad; age limits apply. ([pg.nsfoundation.co.in][14], [presiuniv.ac.in][18])
4. **(Example) Tata Trusts / other foundations** — several Indian philanthropic trusts offer scholarships for higher study — terms vary (confirm on foundation sites). (Use these as supplements, not replacements.) — (see respective foundation pages).

---

# 5 — Eligibility & selection signals for funded admits

**Strong signals that improve funding chances**

* **Research experience** directly relevant to a faculty lab (undergrad thesis, publications, conference papers, code repos). Faculty fund students whose skills match current grants. ([DoResearch][13])
* **High academic performance** (top class rank/GPA) — departments weigh GPA relative to program.
* **Strong letters of recommendation** from researchers who can specifically vouch for your research potential and fit with a PI. Tip: ask referees to comment on *independence, technical skills, and likelihood to contribute to a funded project*.
* **Fit with faculty & active grants** — prior contact to indicate mutual interest is very helpful. ([DoResearch][13])

**Program differences**

* **Engineering / STEM (MS by research / MS/MS)** — more likely to have RA/PI funding opportunities than humanities; some engineering MS students do receive departmental TA/RA support but departments prioritize PhD students. ([Graduate Financial Support][2])
* **Humanities / Arts** — fewer RA/PI positions; funding mostly in fellowships (rare) or TA roles.
* **Business / Professional Master’s (e.g., M.S. in Management, specialized masters)** — often **self-funded** or rely on scholarships specific to the school (professional programs typically have fewer research assistantships). Check specific school (GSB) cost pages. ([Stanford Graduate School of Business][19], [Student Services][20])

---

# 6 — Exact application steps (checklist + samples)

## Checklist (before you submit)

* [ ] **Indicate funding interest** clearly on the departmental application (most Stanford departmental applications have a checkbox or statement field — answer honestly: “Yes — I am seeking funding”). If no explicit place, state it in your Statement of Purpose (1 sentence). ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][15])
* [ ] **Prepare a one-page research statement** targeted to 2–3 faculty (mention techniques, toolkits, and specific labs/projects).
* [ ] **CV with research outputs** and a short list of possible faculty mentors (include faculty names & why fit).
* [ ] **Letters of recommendation** — ask referees to email/indicate willingness to speak with faculty about funding fit.
* [ ] **Apply separately to Knight-Hennessy** (if eligible) — follow KHS timeline & materials (leadership essays, references). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5])
* [ ] **Apply to external Indian scholarships** (Inlaks, Fulbright-Nehru, Narotam) — many require proof of admission or offer conditional on admission. ([studentcover.in][6], [Welcome to][7])

## How to indicate funding interest (sample wording for application SOP)

> “I am seeking funding support (TA/RA/fellowship) for the duration of my program. My research interests align with Prof. A (X lab) and Prof. B (Y lab); I have prior experience in Z and can contribute to ongoing projects described \[specific paper or project].”

## How/when to contact potential supervisors (short plan + email template below)

* **When:** Start **4–8 weeks before** application deadlines if possible; if not, contact after admission decisions but *before* you accept an offer (PIs can only commit if funds are available).
* **What to include:** 2–3 sentence hook (your background), 1 concrete sentence on fit (mention a specific paper/project), 1 sentence on funding ask (“Are you expecting RA positions for incoming MS students in YEAR?”), attach CV & 1-page research summary.

(Email template provided later in section 10.)

# 7 — Documents & evidence for financial-aid consideration (what grad offices expect)

If a department or fellowship asks for financial documentation or evidence, typical items:

* Academic transcripts (official).
* CV / publications / research statement.
* **Sponsor letters** if family/sponsor will contribute (bank letters, employer letters).
* **Bank statements** or official proof of family income for visa/I-20 (often required by Office of International Students & Scholars — see visa/I-20 section). For graduate fellowship review, academic evidence + research productivity matter more than personal finances; for visa issuance you will need proof of funds. ([Student Services][9])

---

# 8 — Cost of attendance & cost-of-living (Stanford official numbers, 2025–26)

**Sources used**

* Stanford Graduate student budget pages (non-tuition expense buckets & Cardinal Care details). ([Stanford Financial Aid][21], [Student Services][22])
* Stanford graduate tuition (typical full-time quarterly tuition & 2025–2026 listed rates). ([Student Services][23])
* Exchange rate used for INR conversions: **1 USD = ₹87.52 (mid-market, 15 Aug 2025)** (wise.com). *I use this rate throughout.* ([Wise][24])

**Key Stanford numbers (official pages)**

* **Typical graduate tuition (example):** 8–10 units per quarter = **\$13,240 per quarter** (2024-25 example; check your program’s 2025-26 page; multi-quarter academic year = 3 quarters typically) → **approx \$39,720 / year**. ([Student Services][23])
* **Non-tuition budget items (Stanford’s student budget page)**: Stanford publishes standard budgets (housing, food, books, personal, transportation, Cardinal Care premium). See Stanford Financial Aid budget page for the grad budget breakdown. ([Stanford Financial Aid][21])

### Master’s example budget (annual) — **typical STEM/Engineering MS** (assumption: 3 quarters per academic year)

> **Assumptions:** Full-time enrollment for 3 quarters (Autumn, Winter, Spring). No GSB/Law/Med premium program rates.

| Item                                    |                             USD (annual) |                            INR (@₹87.52/USD) |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------: |
| Tuition (3 quarters at \$13,240/qtr)    |                                 \$39,720 |       ₹3,476,294.00 ([Student Services][23]) |
| Fees & supplies                         |     \$1,500 (estimate; school fees vary) |                                     ₹131,280 |
| Housing / food (Stanford mid budget)    |    \$17,000 (Stanford grad mid estimate) | ₹1,487,840.00 ([Stanford Financial Aid][21]) |
| Cardinal Care premium (if unsubsidized) | \$2,540 (single-student premium example) |   ₹222,380.80 ([Stanford Financial Aid][21]) |
| Books & personal                        |                                  \$2,000 |                                     ₹175,040 |
| Travel (annual)                         |                                  \$1,500 |                                     ₹131,280 |
| **Estimated total (mid)**               |                             **\$64,260** |                               **₹5,624,115** |

**Notes:**

* These are **example** numbers built from Stanford’s budget page and tuition pages; **your program may differ** (professional masters can be much higher). Always check your program’s specific tuition page. ([Student Services][20], [Stanford Financial Aid][21])

### Convert family income to USD (your specifics)

* **Family income = ₹1,00,000 / month = ₹12,00,000 / year.** Using **1 USD = ₹87.52**, that is:
  \- ₹12,00,000 ÷ 87.52 = **\$13,711.15 / year**. ([Wise][24])

### 3 living scenarios (monthly & annual totals — **INR** and **USD**)

Using the same categories (housing/food + personal + transport + insurance portion). These exclude tuition.

1. **Low-cost (tight student)** — housing share in lower-cost off-campus housing / shared:

   * Monthly non-tuition ≈ **\$1,200** → **₹105,024 / month** → **₹12,60,288 / year**.
2. **Mid (typical grad budget used above)** — monthly non-tuition ≈ **\$1,500** → **₹131,280 / month** → **₹15,75,360 / year**. ([Stanford Financial Aid][21])
3. **High (private housing, more travel, family visits)** — monthly non-tuition ≈ **\$2,200** → **₹192,544 / month** → **₹23,10,528 / year**.

# 9 — Personalized Net-Price Estimate (based on your family income ₹12L/year)

**Conversion used:** ₹12,00,000 / year = **\$13,711** (see math above). ([Wise][24])

### Scenario A — **Self-funded (no fellowship)**

* **Costs (example mid budget):** ≈ **\$64,260 / year** (see example budget). ([Stanford Financial Aid][21], [Student Services][23])
* **Family contribution:** \$13,711/year → covers **\~21%** of annual expenses; remainder to be covered from savings, loans, or income (≈ \$50,549/yr ≈ ₹44,25,824).
* **Likely reality:** Many applicants from India use a **mixture of family savings + education loans (Indian or international)** or take short internships (extended breaks) to cover the gap.

### Scenario B — **Partially funded (TA/RA)** — *typical for a master’s who secures a 25% TA or some RA support*

* **If you secure a 25% assistantship:** departmental policy examples show a **25% appointment can cover a tuition allowance** (check program rules). That can **reduce tuition obligation** substantially (tuition ≈ \$39,720/year might be covered). ([Stanford Graduate School of Education][10])
* **Stipend:** stipend depends on % appointment and the salary table; a 25% appointment implies a stipend that covers a portion of living costs (varies by dept). Assuming stipend covers **\$10,000–\$18,000/yr**, the remaining living gap (mid budget \$64k less stipend and family funds) could be \~\$32k–40k/yr. (This is an **estimate** — departments set stipends; see Salary & TAL tables). ([Graduate Financial Support][12])

### Scenario C — **Fully covered (Knight-Hennessy or major fellowship)**

* **What covered:** KHS provides **full tuition + living stipend + program costs** for up to 3 years. If you receive KHS, **your net price could be \$0 out-of-pocket** aside from incidental personal choices. ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][3])

**How outside scholarships affect Stanford funding**

* Many external awards can be **stacked** with Stanford funding, but **Stanford may reduce institutional aid** if your external award covers costs Stanford previously committed to (policies vary by award and school). Always disclose external awards promptly — departments coordinate packaging. ([Student Services][22])

---

# 10 — Application timeline (90-day Fall admission oriented)

**Assume target intake: Autumn (Sep) — 90-day action plan (generic):**

* **Day 1–10:** Finalize list of Stanford programs & faculty; prepare 1-page targeted research statement; prepare referee list.
* **Day 11–25:** Submit department applications (or complete online forms), **check “funding interest” box**; submit Knight-Hennessy application (if applying). ([knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5])
* **Day 26–45:** Send targeted emails to 3–6 faculty (short, personalized — template below).
* **Day 46–60:** Complete external scholarship applications (Inlaks, Narotam, Fulbright cycles vary — check each deadline). ([studentcover.in][6], [pg.nsfoundation.co.in][14])
* **Day 61–90:** Prepare interview materials; if admitted, ask about funding timelines and reply to offers.

**Deadline reminders:** Department deadlines differ — check each program page and Knight-Hennessy deadlines. ([Student Services][20], [knight-hennessy.stanford.edu][5])

# 11 — After-admission actions (read award letter, appeals, visa)

## How to read an award letter (line-by-line checklist)

* [ ] **Type of award:** fellowship vs appointment (RA/TA) vs one-time award.
* [ ] **Tuition coverage:** which quarters/years is tuition covered? (Full/partial/percent). ([Graduate Financial Support][12])
* [ ] **Stipend amount & disbursement frequency** (monthly/quarterly). ([Student Services][9])
* [ ] **Employment requirement** (hours, duties, duration).
* [ ] **Cardinal Care subsidy** (is health insurance premium subsidized? level tied to assistantship %). ([Student Services][22], [Grad Policies and Procedures][11])
* [ ] **Renewal conditions** (GPA, satisfactory progress, availability of funds).
* [ ] **Conditions for reduction** if you receive external awards (order of funds). ([Student Services][22])

## Appeal / request for more funding — what to include

* New, concrete information: competing offer from another university, new external fellowship, significant demonstrated financial hardship, or changed family income. Attach evidence (employer letter, bank statements, copy of competing offer). (Template below.)

## Visa / I-20 funding proof

* **What appears on I-20:** Stanford will require proof of funds to issue I-20 (combination of Stanford award letter + family bank statements + loan sanction letters). Stanford’s international student services and financial aid pages explain acceptable documents. Scholarship letters from Stanford are used toward required funding. ([Student Services][9])

## Health insurance (Cardinal Care)

* **If funded by an assistantship (≥25%) or fellowship**, Stanford typically **subsidizes the Cardinal Care premium** (level of subsidy tied to appointment). If you are funded, confirm the subsidy percentage & deadline to waive or enroll. ([Student Services][22], [Grad Policies and Procedures][11])

## B — Email to Financial Aid / Department requesting reconsideration / appeal (after admission)

Subject: Request for funding reconsideration — \[Your Name], admitted to \[Program], Autumn 2026

```
Dear [Graduate Coordinator / Financial Aid Officer],

Thank you for the admission offer to [Program]. I am writing to respectfully request reconsideration for departmental/fellowship funding due to financial constraints.

Family income: ₹1,00,000/month (₹12,00,000/year). While my family is committed to supporting my studies, the estimated Stanford cost of attendance creates a significant shortfall. [If applicable, mention: I have been awarded/shortlisted for external scholarship X (attach), or I have competing offer Y with funding Z — attach documentation.]

Attachments:
1) Admission letter  
2) Current funding offer letter (if any)  
3) Family income proof (salary slips / employer letter / ITR summary)  
4) Bank statement / loan sanction letter (if available)  
5) Short statement of impact / reason for reconsideration (1 page)

I would be grateful if you could advise whether additional departmental support (TA/RA, fellowship, one-time bridge grant) is possible or whether you can direct me to other campus resources. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
[Your name]  
[Application ID / SUID]

# 13 — Tailoring note & next steps (what extra info I need to make this precise for you)

To tailor exact odds, stipend numbers, and a **program-specific** budget, tell me:

* Which **department/program** at Stanford you’re targeting (e.g., CS MS, Electrical Eng MS, MS in Statistics, M.A. in History, M.S. in Management).
* Whether you expect to apply for **coursework master’s** or a **research-oriented MS** (research MS are more likely to get RA funding).
  If you prefer, I’ll use **STEM/Engineering MS** as the default (which I used above).

If you want, I’ll now:

* (A) **Tailor this guide to a specific Stanford program** (e.g., CS MS vs. M.S. in Electrical Engineering) and produce a department-specific funding likelihood + typical stipend numbers, OR
* (B) **Draft the 1-page research summary and two emails** (faculty + appeal) personalized with your background — if you paste a short bio (degrees, key project, 1–2 papers).
