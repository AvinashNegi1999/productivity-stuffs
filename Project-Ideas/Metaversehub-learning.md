# 📌 Recap (Your Personal Path)

1. **Year 1** → Python + DSA + Full-Stack basics (Frontend, Backend, DB).
2. **Year 2** → Cloud + AI/ML + Blockchain + Cross-platform.
3. **Year 3** → MetaVerse integration + Startup launch.

---

if you stick to **15 hrs/week (your current pace)**:

* This roadmap = \~3.5 years realistically.
* But if you scale up (25–30 hrs/week), you can compress it to **2.5 years**.
