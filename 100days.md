Of course\! Here is the complete, revised README file with all the suggested improvements implemented.

I have:

1.  **Corrected** the repository link in the "last-commit" badge.
2.  **Removed** the redundant project list from the "Notes" section.
3.  **Restructured** the daily logs into clean, collapsible sections.
4.  **Added** a new `"My Key Takeaway"` column to the tables for you to add personal notes. I've filled in the first few days as an example.

You can copy and paste the entire content below directly into your `README.md` file.
